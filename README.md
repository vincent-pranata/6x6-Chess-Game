## About ##

6x6 Chess Game is basically a variation of a chess game. It is played in a 6x6 board while only having <br>
6 pieces for each player. Each player has 2 rooks, 2 knight, and 2 bishops, and they can also combine <br>
and seperate their pieces. If player combine their pieces, the combined pieces will be able to move like <br>
combined pieces (e.g. bishop and knight combined, then that piece will be able to move like both bishop <br> 
and knight). When a player take an enemy pieces,they will receive a point and 5 points for a combined piece. <br>
The winner will be the player who has the most point when the game ends or when a player manages to take all <br>
of the enemy pieces.
